## Statement of Purpose ##

官方对于 Statement of Purpose 是这样描述的：

Applicants for our graduate programs are selected using a holistic evaluation system. This essay will assist both the admissions committee and fellowship review committees to  evaluate your preparation for the proposed field of study. In your statement of purpose, please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization.

热门的学校和专业，仅来自中国的申请就有可能近千份，所以录取委员会的教授没有时间仔细去看所有的 PS/Resume 。基本是快速扫描一下，留下比较强的一小部分人来考虑是否录取。

**反复突出自己的长板**

> 一封好的 PS 在于瞬间传递了最有价值的信息。不要因为 CV 中有的内容就不在 PS 中反复强调。罗列经验和讲故事的 PS 不会在委员会留下丝毫印象，除非你的其他条件十分优秀，能够保证在多轮筛选中存留下来，那就可以在这里讲情怀，说故事。


### PS 的内容和结构 ###


**内容上遵循官方的指引**

A sample of topics that you might address in your statement is below:

- Academic plans and research interests
- Relevant experience
- Future career goals
- Why UCLA would be a good intellectual fit for you

We recommend that you complete the essay in another program (i.e. Word, Google docs, etc) and copy it in the text box below. (1200 word maximum.)
